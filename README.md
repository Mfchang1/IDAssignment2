# WebKart

WebKart, is a responsive and user-friendly eCommerce platform designed using commerce.js, to create an interactive online shopping experience for customers.

WebKart contains the content of multiple items on stock, including the item's description and price. Customers can freely browse through and choose what they would want to purchase, by adding their desired items to a shopping cart, which has the option to remove certain items depending on the customer. With lightweight and simple design for our website, customers can focus on the functionality of WebKart and shop easily. Moreover, with the addition of React Hook Form's API for customer's input details and Stripe.js' API to tokenize customer information, collect sensitive payment details and accept payment with browser payment API to enhance their experience during payment of items, we believe that the uniqueness and complexity of our application differs to existing Ecommerce websites, therefore attracting customers to shop at WebKart. WebKart also provides customers a splendid shopping experience that is convenient and reliable.

## Design Process

WebKart is a business driven interactive web application, whereby we are able to view and track sales through statistics using commerce.js, therefore focusing on the functionality of the website. We have designed WebKart to be user friendly for customers to easily browse through the website and at the same time to be responsive on both desktop and mobile platforms. As we have focused on the functionality of our eCommerce website, we have researched and took into consideration of what features customers want to normally view and experience on an online shopping website. As customers, we would want to view the information, descripton and price of items, and also be able to add/remvoe items from a cart. Moreover, customers would also want the payment section to be especially convenient and safe.

During the creation of wireframes, we also took into consideration of what customers would want to see in a shopping website aesthetcially, and thus came up with a rather simple design. Thereafter, we researched on the colour scheme which are appealing to the eye and visualised it in our wireframe. Since WebKart is business driven website, we decided on the colours to be more professional and chose mainly dull colorus(grey & white). Our website's visual design is minimalistic, so that users are not cluttered with information, and are able to easily interact with the web application. Initially, the design of our wireframe was rather too simple, and once we started to implement its design into the website, we improved the design of our wireframe and updated our website. Here is the link to our wireframe, [Adobe XD](https://xd.adobe.com/view/9ad2b151-f7ff-48fc-aad1-233e9c76a464-cf81/).
